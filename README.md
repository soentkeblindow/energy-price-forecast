# Day-Ahead Power Price Forecasting & Risk Backtesting (DE-LU)

Probabilistic forecasts with conformal calibration, ES/VaR backtesting, and regime-conditional validation.

<!-- badges: added in 5.4 -->

Probabilistic day-ahead price forecasting for the German-Luxembourg bidding zone (ENTSO-E data), comparing regularised linear baselines, LightGBM quantile regression, and ARIMAX under a strictly leakage-free walk-forward evaluation at gate-closure information (~12:00 D-1). The forecast intervals are then conformal-calibrated, and the resulting trading-book Value-at-Risk / Expected Shortfall of a hypothetical 10 MW book is **backtested in its own right** -- the same lens an independent model-validation unit would apply, not just a point-accuracy comparison.

Unconditionally the calibrated risk measure holds: Kupiec does not reject the breach-rate null anywhere at the `overall` subset. Conditionally it does not -- 35 of 60 validated (variant, side, subset) cells break coverage even under an honest, month-stratified day-block bootstrap test, concentrated in the evening ramp and the tail forecast-height buckets. That gap between unconditional and conditional calibration is the project's central finding, not a footnote.

## Headline results

All metrics on the common 2021-2025 walk-forward test set (rolling-90-day window, `refit_every=1` for LightGBM, `refit_every=7` for ARIMAX).

| Model | MAE (EUR/MWh) | RMSE (EUR/MWh) | WAPE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seasonal Naive | 34.77 | 56.20 | 0.290 |
| Lasso | 24.23 | 38.40 | 0.202 |
| ARIMAX | 22.87 | 35.74 | 0.191 |
| **LightGBM** | **15.40** | **26.59** | **0.129** |

- **LightGBM leads by a wide margin:** MAE 15.4 EUR/MWh vs. 22.9-24.2 for ARIMAX/Lasso and 34.8 for the naive benchmark -- roughly 37% lower error than the best alternative model.
- **Raw quantile intervals massively under-cover:** reporting the raw, uncalibrated q05 as a 5% VaR limit breaches in 18.3% (long) / 17.8% (short) of hours, not 5%. Scaled conformal recalibration fixes this: breach rates drop to 4.9% (long) / 5.2% (short), and the implied capital buffer is 1.53x (long) / 1.76x (short) larger than the uncalibrated one would have reported.
- **The calibrated risk measure passes the unconditional backtest but fails the conditional one:** Kupiec does not reject at `overall`, yet 35 of 60 conditioning cells (hour-of-day phase, forecast-height bucket, forecast-based regime) break coverage under an honest bootstrap CI -- see the signature figure above.

## What makes this honest

- **Gate-closure leakage discipline.** Every feature is restricted to information known by ~12:00 Europe/Berlin on D-1, the real day-ahead gate-closure time -- not information available only in hindsight.
- **Walk-forward, not a random split.** All backtests use a rolling or expanding time-ordered evaluation; hyperparameter tuning happens in an inner loop nested inside that walk-forward, never touching test-period data.
- **Calibration before risk, never the other way round.** The trading-book VaR/ES is computed on top of already-calibrated quantile forecasts, not on raw model output dressed up as a risk number.
- **The risk measure is backtested, not just computed.** Three independent statistical test families -- Kupiec (frequency), Christoffersen (clustering), Acerbi-Szekely (severity) -- plus a month-stratified, day-block bootstrap for honest confidence intervals, applied to all 60 (variant x side x subset) cells.
- **Findings are reported even when they complicate the story.** The conditional coverage breaks, the day-level breach clustering, and the ARIMAX under-coverage are stated as findings, not smoothed over -- see Honest limitations below.

## Figures

![Fan chart: raw vs. calibrated quantile bands](outputs/assets/fan_chart_calibration.png)

Fan chart over a two-week window (2024-12-05 to 2024-12-19) containing the single highest-spread day in the test period (2024-12-12, ~829 EUR/MWh spread, a documented winter Dunkelflaute event). The raw 90% band (left) is visibly too narrow during the spike; the conformal-calibrated band (right) widens specifically where the raw band would have missed the realised price.

Nominal vs. empirical one-sided coverage per quantile level. Raw LightGBM sits below the diagonal (under-coverage); the calibrated curve tracks the diagonal closely; ARIMAX (pale reference, 3-level grid only) under-covers more severely -- at the 0.95 level, empirical coverage is 62.3% against a 95% nominal target.

![Forecast vs. actual, daily means](outputs/assets/forecast_vs_actual.png)

Daily-mean actual price vs. LightGBM median forecast over the full test period. The 2021/22 energy-crisis peak and the subsequent normalisation are clearly visible; the model tracks both regimes closely.

Data flows raw (ENTSO-E/commodities APIs) -> interim (hourly, normalised) -> features (leakage-safe) -> backtest predictions -> calibration/risk evaluation -> `outputs/` (the small, checked-in snapshot this README and the future dashboard read from).

## Getting started

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your ENTSO-E API key (Transparency Platform)

# Rebuild the feature pipeline from raw data (optional -- not needed to read this README)
uv run python scripts/build_interim.py
uv run python scripts/build_features.py

# Regenerate the figures/tables this README embeds, from already-persisted results
make report-assets
```

`outputs/results/` contains checked-in, versioned snapshots of the backtest, calibration, and risk results -- the figures above and the numbers in this README are reproducible directly from those files, without needing an ENTSO-E API key or a full pipeline re-run. Raw data sources: ENTSO-E Transparency Platform (day-ahead prices, load, generation, cross-border flows) and Yahoo Finance (TTF gas, EUA CO2 futures); raw data itself is not redistributed in this repository.

## Honest limitations

- **Conditional coverage breaks in 35 of 60 cells**, concentrated in the evening ramp and the tail forecast-height buckets -- the calibration corrects the unconditional scale but not this conditional structure. In the evening ramp, `calibrated`/short alone breaches at 9.5% against a nominal 5% (CI [8.4%, 10.6%]) -- close to double the target rate in exactly the hours the book is most exposed.
- **Day-level breach clustering survives the conformal correction.** Christoffersen's day-level independence test rejects independence for every validated (variant, side) combination at `overall` (`LR_ind` 53-104) -- breaches bunch into multi-day runs (cold snaps, Dunkelflauten), not just isolated hours.
- **Kupiec on the raw hourly series is anti-conservative.** It rejects 43 of the same 60 cells -- more than the bootstrap's 35 -- because intra-day breaches are correlated and the hourly chi-square test does not know that. The honest, day-block-bootstrapped test is the one this project reports as the headline; Kupiec is shown alongside it, not in place of it.
- **ARIMAX's quantile intervals under-cover more severely than LightGBM's, even before calibration.** At the 0.95 level, empirical coverage is 62.3% against a 95% nominal target, vs. LightGBM raw's 81.1% at the same level -- the documented cost of a classical linear-Gaussian interval assumption against a heavy-tailed, regime-switching price series.
- **The energy-crisis period (2021/22) is a structural stress test for every model**, not a regime any of them was specifically tuned for -- performance there is reported, not excluded.

## Future work

- **LSTM/Transformer comparison** -- deliberately out of scope: the marginal accuracy gain over a well-tuned LightGBM quantile model is unlikely to justify the added complexity and interpretability cost for this use case.
- **Diebold-Mariano significance test** on the LightGBM-vs-baseline MAE edge -- time-boxed and optional for this project phase; would add a formal significance statement alongside the already-reported effect size.
- **Regime-adaptive calibration** (e.g. a ramp term in the local-scale estimate) -- the conditional coverage breaks documented above point directly at this as the next methodological step, not attempted here.
- **Further risk measures** (drawdown statistics, extreme quantiles beyond q05/q95) -- out of scope for a backtesting-focused deliverable.
